# Config

Check the full `Config` documentation here: [https://gacela-project.com/docs/config/](https://gacela-project.com/docs/config/)

Use a Config Class to construct your business domain classes by injecting the data from the Config using the Factory
when you do the creation of your domain classes.

In order to achieve that, you need to create a `gacela.json` file in your application root.
